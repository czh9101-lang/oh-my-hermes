class SkillDensityGateTests(unittest.TestCase):
    """Standing density gate for the always-loaded skill bodies.

    `FULL_PROFILE_SKILL_BODY_CHAR_LIMIT` (src/maintenance/release.py) ratchets
    the pack's total bytes. It cannot separate a body that grew because a
    workflow gained a rule from one that grew because the prose got wordier.
    This gate measures the second thing per skill.

    Measured distribution over all 108 catalog skills at the time these
    thresholds were set (`omh.quality.skill_density.skill_density_payload()`):

    | signal | min | median | max |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | `filler_hits` | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | `repeated_share_percent` | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
    | `payload_markers_per_1k` | 10.03 | 13.17 | 21.3 |

    Thresholds follow from those three rows:

    - Filler ceiling 0. The corpus carries zero hits from the reviewed phrase
      list today, so the gate is a ratchet on a clean corpus rather than a
      cleanup target. A non-zero tolerance here would only buy the first
      author who wants one.
    - Repeated-share ceiling 5.0%. Intra-skill repetition is also zero today,
      but the ceiling is deliberately not 0: repeating the single most
      important rule at the end of a long body is a positioning decision, not
      bloat, and a hard zero would forbid it. 5.0% leaves room for exactly one
      such repeat in a median-length body while still failing a section
      pasted twice.
    - Payload floor 9.0 markers per 1,000 prose chars, about 10% below the
      measured worst legitimate case (`llm-app-dev`, 10.03 -- the largest body
      with the most narrative framing). Set at today's worst it would fail on
      the next rounding; set at the median it would fail a third of the
      catalog for style.

    Nothing is exempted: `DENSITY_REVIEWED_EXEMPTIONS` is empty and the gate
    passes on today's corpus.
