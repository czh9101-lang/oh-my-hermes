"""Shared platform-capability probes and skip decorators (issue #781).

Windows lacks the POSIX primitives several OMH surfaces are built on
(O_NOFOLLOW / O_DIRECTORY dirfd-anchored opens, fcntl advisory locks,
mode-bit enforcement, mkfifo, killpg). Product code fails closed on such
platforms by design; these decorators keep the corresponding tests scoped
to hosts where the exercised contract can hold, following the guard
conventions established by #771 and #778.
