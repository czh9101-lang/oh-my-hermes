"""Shared platform-capability probes and skip decorators (issue #781).

Windows lacks the POSIX primitives several OMH surfaces are built on
(O_NOFOLLOW / O_DIRECTORY dirfd-anchored opens, mode-bit enforcement, mkfifo,
killpg). Product code fails closed on such platforms by design; these
decorators keep the corresponding tests scoped to hosts where the exercised
contract can hold, following the guard conventions established by #771 and
#778.

Mutual exclusion is deliberately *not* on that list. `fcntl` is POSIX-only,
but the capability built on it is not: `local_store.file_lock` falls back to
`msvcrt.locking` and reports `enforced: True` either way, so a concurrency
contract holds on both platforms. Pick the gate that names the capability
under test, not the primitive the POSIX half happens to use --
`requires_enforced_file_lock` for mutual exclusion, `requires_fcntl_locks`
only where the test asserts something about `fcntl` itself. Gating mutual
exclusion on `fcntl` left Windows with no concurrent coverage of the lock
path at all, and that is where a silent data-loss defect lived until #1467.
