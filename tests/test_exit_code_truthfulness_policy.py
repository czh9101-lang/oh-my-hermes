"""Gate: a command's exit code never reports success over failed work.

On 2026-09-11 two real dispatches ended with "You've hit your session limit",
every unit failed, and `omh coding fanout dispatch` exited **0**. A wrapper
reading only the status was told the batch succeeded, the plan's checklist
stayed marked running, and the operator learned otherwise only by opening the
report. `_fanout_dispatch_exit_code` had a case for a refusal -- with a
docstring saying in as many words that "a shell that only checks the status
must not read 'nothing was dispatched' as success" -- and no case for a unit
that ran and failed. The sentence was right and it had only been applied to
half the ways work does not happen.

This module re-derives every exit-code mapper from source rather than naming
them, so the class cannot come back through a function nobody added here. It
is deliberately narrow: it does not say what a mapper must return for any
particular input, only that a summary carrying a failure signal must not map
to 0. A new command is free to define its own vocabulary, its own recoverable
lane and its own codes; it is not free to call failure success.
