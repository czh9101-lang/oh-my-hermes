"""The code-review reference files carry clauses that prevent a wrong answer.

These are not style assertions. Each locked string below is the one sentence in
its section that stops a specific failure: a review that covered a fraction of
the change, a fix that was attempted rather than made, or a partial
implementation of a finding set that was not understood. A rewrite that drops
one of them should fail here rather than ship quietly.
