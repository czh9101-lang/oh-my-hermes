"""The a11y-rules reference carries the clauses that keep an audit comparable.

Each locked string prevents a specific failure: a finding written as prose
instead of a rule ID, a meaning-dependent fix marked auto-fixable (which
ships confident, wrong alternative text), a half-structural fix rounded to
one side, a rerun that cannot say what was resolved, or a fix class read as
evidence the fix was applied. A rewrite that drops one should fail here
rather than ship.
