"""Global language policy for routing.

OMH targets a global audience with English as the primary language. Its
deterministic trigger tables only ever grew in Latin and Hangul, and these
tests used to hold that state still on the reasoning that per-language trigger
tables do not scale, so non-English intent resolution belonged to model
selection rather than to more tokens.

Trigger language packs (`src/routing/trigger_language_packs.py`) changed the
premise. A language's phrases are validated data merged into the catalog, so
adding one is authoring `src/routing/trigger_packs/<lang>.json` rather than
editing the router, and the cost that made the old policy sensible -- source
churn per language, paid by whoever owns the catalog -- is not there any more.
So the tests keep what was actually load-bearing and drop what was a
consequence of the old storage:

* The per-skill Korean freeze stays, restated: an existing skill's table must
  not be padded to make a routing miss go away. It reads the merged catalog, so
  moving Korean into `ko.json` did not weaken it by a single entry, and padding
  the pack fails exactly the way padding the source did.
* Which scripts are trigger-backed is measured from the catalog rather than
  declared in a constant, so shipping a pack is what makes a script supported.
* Every routable skill must still be reachable in English: English is the base
  corpus, and a skill that only a pack can reach is a skill most users cannot.

# Frozen per skill on 2026-07-27, not as a global total.
#
# The first version of this gate froze the sum, and it fired on the very next
# merge: three new skills arrived carrying their own Korean triggers and the
# total moved 766 -> 774. That is not the habit worth stopping. A new skill
# paying for its own triggers is proportional work; padding an existing skill's
# Korean table to paper over a routing miss is the unbounded one, and a sum
# cannot tell the two apart.
#
# So the freeze is per skill, and only for skills that existed at freeze time.
# A new skill is exempt here and constrained instead by
# `test_every_routable_skill_is_reachable_in_english`. Raising an entry below
# means an existing Korean table grew: do it only with a stated reason, and
# never to make a routing miss go away.
#
# 2026-08-30: these phrases moved from source literals into
# `src/routing/trigger_packs/ko.json`. The counts below did not move with them
# -- they are read off the merged catalog, which is where the router reads them
# too -- so the freeze covers the pack exactly as it covered the source.
# The specialist-domain set is an explicit task exception to the no-growth policy:
# every new skill carries exactly its three approved narrow Korean phrases.
