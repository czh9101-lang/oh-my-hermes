# Model onboarding

The repeatable maintainer loop for the day a model family ships a new
generation (Claude Fable 5 → 5.1, GLM 5.2 → 5.3) or a new sibling (Mythos
5.1 next to Fable 5.1). It is the repo-side counterpart of the installable
`model-optimization` skill: that skill tells Hermes how to run the process in
chat; this file tells the executor working on the repo which files move, in
which order, and what proves each step. `MODEL_OPTI.md` is the reader's map
of the calibration surface and stays the source of provenance.

Boundary first: OMH never calls a model. Everything below is prepared text,
prepared configuration, or documentation. Nothing here is execution, review,
CI, or merge evidence, and a routed model is never proof that a provider
serves it.

## 0. Frame the goal

One user goal → one PR (see Delivery Grain in `AGENTS.md`). A generation
bump is one goal even though it touches ~20 files; do not split it into
"chains" and "docs" PRs. Measurement is the one valid second PR, because it
needs a served route the first PR may not have.

Branch before the first edit: `claude/<family>-<generation>-onboarding`.

## 1. Recognize

Prove what the router sees before touching anything:

```sh
uv run python -m omh.cli coding model-route --executor hermes --model <id> --effort xhigh --role implementation --json
```

Read `model_family` and `effort_change.kind`. Probe every id as served
(`claude-fable-5-1`, `anthropic/claude-fable-5-1`) and every bare name users
type in chat (`fable`, `mythos`). When the vendor documents an effort
vocabulary that differs from the family's (GPT-6 Astra: `none` is HTTP 400,
`low` is the floor), record it as an exact-model contract in
`src/coding/model_contracts.py` and probe the unsupported rungs too — the
route must answer `floor_raised`, never pass the rung through;
`omh coding model-contract --model <id>` prints the record. When the vendor
instead publishes a mapping for undocumented rungs and returns no error
(DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: ladder `low`/`high`/`max`; `minimal` → `low`,
`medium` and `xhigh` → `high`, `ultra` → `max`), leave `unsupported_efforts`
empty, record the table in the contract's `effort_mapping`, and let the
route pass the rung through on record — the record says what the rung
bought, and the chains name only documented rungs.

When the vendor or host exposes multiple spellings for one documented model,
do not infer inheritance by stripping suffixes. Add only the reviewed catalog
ids to `DECLARED_MODEL_CONTRACT_PROJECTIONS`, preserve the requested/provider-
qualified id in the route receipt, and resolve a separate canonical contract
id, reasoning mode, service tier, and `exact`/`declared_inheritance`
provenance. Keep the plugin bundle's explicit mirror parity-tested for
provider eligibility, category projection, and approximate pricing. The host
or runtime owns wire translation. A catalog row is neither entitlement nor
execution evidence, and a malformed or future suffix remains uncontracted
until it receives an explicit declaration. The one shape that projects
without a declared row is a vendor's dated snapshot (`<base>-YYYY-MM-DD`,
OpenAI's convention; a provider that serves only `gpt-5.6-terra-2026-07-09`
was reported 2026-09-11): `dated_snapshot_base()` in
`src/coding/model_contracts.py` and its plugin mirror strip only that
trailing shape, and every caller projects it only onto a base it already
knows — a contract, a declared row, a priced or provider-mapped alias, a
chain entry — at that base's own mode and tier, with `dated_snapshot`
provenance. Probe the dated form in this step too; an unknown base with a
date must stay unknown.

A bare name that classifies `unknown` gets generic discipline; add it to
`_CLAUDE_TIER_ALIASES` (Claude) or the prefix tables in
`src/coding/model_routing.py`, with a `model_family` test. Bare vendor names
(`deepseek`, `minimax`, `astra`) stay `unknown` by pinned decision — only the
Claude tier words are bare aliases — so probe the versioned ids and the
vendor's pointer id (`deepseek-flash`), not the vendor name.

### Served, not released

A released id, a catalog row, and a routed model are three different things,
and none of them is a served route. Before any measurement or machine
placement, prove the route with one call through the profile that will run
the benchmark, and read the usage file, not the exit code:

```sh
hermes --oneshot "Reply with exactly the single word OK." --in "$PWD" \
  --provider <provider> --model <id> --reasoning low --usage-file usage.json
```

`usage.json` names the `model` and `provider` that answered and a
`cost_status` (`included` for a subscription route, `unknown` when the host
cannot price it); a provider rejection lands there too, with `failed: true`.
Gateways serve vendor-prefixed ids (`z-ai/glm-5.2-ultrafast`,
`moonshotai/kimi-k3-ultrafast`) and reject the bare alias, so probe the id
exactly as the manifest will name it. GPT-6 Astra sat "released" for a day
before the owner account served it; #1310 stayed blocked on this probe, not
on the release note.

### Contract coverage audit

Capture or supply a local inventory, then run the deterministic audit before
and after the onboarding change:

```sh
uv run python -m omh.cli coding model-inventory --json > /tmp/model-inventory.json
uv run python -m omh.cli coding model-contract-audit \
  --inventory /tmp/model-inventory.json \
  --required-model <provider/model-id> \
  --recommended-model <provider/secondary-id> \
  --json
```

`--inventory -` reads stdin. Each flag is repeatable; use
`--intentional-exclusion <id>` only for a reviewed model that is deliberately
outside OMH's contract scope. Input is bounded local JSON (1 MiB maximum), and
the command performs no network calls, configuration writes, route changes,
or issue creation. Its stable `model_contract_coverage/v1` comparison body has
no timestamps and includes inventory source/digest plus per-id exact,
`declared_inheritance`, `intentional_exclusion`, or `missing` status. The
per-id dimensions cover family recognition, contract, effort, high-effort and
composition calibration, provider eligibility, category projection, price
source/absence, and docs. Required missing contracts return nonzero;
recommended and optional discoveries remain advisory. Cold/unavailable
inventories remain distinct from observed empty inventories.

Use the digest diff and missing rows as inputs to model optimization,
onboarding, doctor triage, or a release checklist. They are evidence-bounded
work items, not automatic route changes or provider-readiness claims.

## 2. Research, official first — four lanes, in parallel

For Anthropic models the bundled `claude-api` skill's migration guide is the
official source (model ids, pricing, effort semantics, prompt-tunable
behavioral shifts). For other families: the vendor's release notes, thinking
and tool-calling contract, context and output limits, list pricing, speed
tiers. Run the lanes below as separate read-only research agents at the same
time — each writes one dossier under `.omc/research/<family>-<generation>/`
with every claim labeled official, community, or observed; a community claim
never overrides an official contract.

1. **Official** — the vendor's docs, change log, pricing page, and model
   card. Quote the effort table verbatim when one exists (DeepSeek publishes
   `minimal → low`, `medium → high`, `xhigh → high`, `ultra → max`; a
   paraphrase like "nearest level" is not the contract).
2. **Hermes runtime (observed)** — read the installed Hermes Agent AND
   `origin/main` of the upstream checkout for the family:
   `plugins/model-providers/<vendor>/__init__.py` (what the wire carries per
   effort, whether thinking is sent explicitly), `hermes_cli/model_normalize.py`
   (which typed ids are folded or passed through), `agent/reasoning_effort.py`
   (the per-family ladder and overrides), `agent/message_sanitization.py` /
   `chat_completion_helpers.py` (reasoning passback), `agent/model_metadata.py`
   and `agent/usage_pricing.py` (limits and the price snapshot Hermes bills
   with). This lane is the one that shows what the wire will carry: it is how
   the DeepSeek round learned that the first-party API rejects the versioned
   id and that Hermes escalates `xhigh` to `max`. It also tells you which
   Hermes build the chain alias needs (`omh update` does not upgrade Hermes;
   say "once the installed Hermes Agent moves to build X").
3. **Vendor harness (official)** — when the vendor publishes its own agent
   harness (`deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`), read its presets, system prompt,
   editor contract, and the model adapter/serializer. The adapter records API
   rejections the docs omit (DeepSeek: an assistant turn whose answer sits
   only in the reasoning channel is rejected), and the preset the vendor
   benchmarks with says how much scaffolding the model wants (DeepSeek:
   Minimal — one shell tool, a one-line persona — scored above Standard).
4. **Community harnesses** — OpenCode / models.dev, OpenRouter's endpoint
   listing, oh-my-openagent, oh-my-pi, Aider, and the issue trackers. Use
   them for divergence (which ids 400, which harnesses drop the passback,
   who records off-peak as list price), never for the contract.

Each dossier ends with candidate trait → counter sentences tied to a quoted
source line, and none of them may push the model to keep working.

## 3. Calibrate, trait to counter

`src/coding/unit_prompt_protocol.py` holds two tables keyed by family:
`HIGH_EFFORT_CALIBRATIONS` (subagent) and `MAIN_AGENT_COMPOSITION_CALIBRATIONS`
(composer), and two keyed by exact model id that resolve before them:
`MODEL_HIGH_EFFORT_CALIBRATIONS` and `MODEL_COMPOSITION_CALIBRATIONS`. Write
the counter for a documented trait, version-aware where generations differ
— in the family table when the trait holds across the family, in the
exact-model table when the new generation's documented traits differ from
the family's and the older generation's prompts must stay byte-stable (GPT-6
Astra over GPT-5.6) — and keep counters the guide says to keep even when it
reads as redundant (for Claude 5.1: the single verification pass). Do not
restate universal protocol rules inside a family entry. Then:

- Update the family's section in `MODEL_OPTI.md` (trait, injected text,
  version rule, source). `tests/test_unit_prompt_protocol.py` fails when a
  calibrated family has no section.
- Stay under `UNIT_PROMPT_MAX_BYTES`; the worst-case prompt test measures
  the longest family block.

## 4. Place routing

Rules that have held across every onboarding so far:

- The new generation takes every slot the family already held, and the
  superseded generation leaves the shipped chains (owner decision,
  2026-09-11, applied in one pass to Fable 5 behind 5.1, GLM 5.2 and its
  Ultrafast tier behind the 5.3 generation, DeepSeek V3.2 behind V4.1 Flash,
  and GPT-5.6 Sol behind GPT-6 Astra on the two frontier slots). The public
  table names the current generation of each line; a machine whose provider
  still serves only the older id keeps it through `omh model-chains set`.
  The retired alias stays recognized, priced, and provider-mapped — list it
  in `_RECOGNITION_ONLY_ALIAS_FAMILIES` (`tests/test_provider_entitlements.py`)
  and keep its `APPROX_PRICE_PER_MTOK` row — so that operator override still
  resolves and still costs out. Before 2026-09-11 the rule was the opposite
  (old generation stays as fall-through); do not reintroduce it by copying an
  older comment.
- A chain names the id the vendor's own API serves, not the spelling a
  gateway or a model card uses. DeepSeek serves `deepseek-flash` and
  rejects `deepseek-v4.1-flash` with HTTP 400, so the chain names the
  pointer and the versioned contract sits behind it as a declared
  projection (`DECLARED_MODEL_CONTRACT_PROJECTIONS`) and is listed in
  `EXACT_CONTRACT_POINTER_ALIASES` (source and plugin mirror) so the plugin's
  `mixture_category_for` projects in both directions and a child observed
  under either spelling keeps its category label; a mode or tier variant is
  not a pointer and only projects forward. Read the Hermes provider
  profile for the family before choosing the alias — it is the one place
  that shows what the wire will carry.
- An access-restricted sibling (Mythos 5.1 = Fable 5.1 under Project
  Glasswing) stays out of every shipped chain: naming a model most accounts
  cannot reach reads as a second model in the public tables. Keep it
  recognized, priced, and routable for a user who asks for it by name.
- The Claude vendor order inside any chain is Fable 5.1 → Opus 5 (owner
  decision, 2026-09-06). The Hermes lane and the Maestro lane are different
  surfaces and both follow it.
- Shipped defaults change only with explicit owner approval; the operator's
  own placement goes through `omh model-chains set` and
  `omh coding category-maestro set`, never by hand-editing the JSON.
- A routing signal that lifts a request class to a tier only helps if that
  tier's chain head passes the class's work on this machine. Measure the
  head on the class before shipping the signal: on 2026-09-05 the
  `exhaustive_search` signal lifted six search tasks to `unspecified-high`,
  whose shipped head (Kimi K3 ultrafast) scored 0 / 6 on them, GLM 2 / 6,
  Sol and Astra 6 / 6. The signal was right and the head was wrong; the
  README documents the one-line chain override that makes the number real.

Files that move together (grep the old id to find every site):

| Surface | File |
| --- | --- |
| Hermes-lane editorial chains | `src/coding/model_recommendations.py` |
| Plugin mirror of those chains + approximate price table | `src/plugin_bundle/omh/hermes_delegation.py` (parity test in `tests/test_plugin_hermes_delegation.py`) |
| Maestro-lane built-in table + executor option rows | `src/coding/model_routing.py` (`BUILTIN_CATEGORY_MODELS`, `EXECUTOR_MODEL_OPTIONS`) |
| `model-setup` skill text naming the chains verbatim | `src/skills/catalog_definitions.py` → regenerate `skills/omh-model-setup/SKILL.md` and `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` |
| Skill body budget note | `src/maintenance/release.py` (`FULL_PROFILE_SKILL_BODY_CHAR_LIMIT`, add the `old -> new` line) |
| Hand-maintained public chain tables | `README.md`, `README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.zh.md`, `site/index.html`, `site/docs/model-routing/index.html` (`tests/test_model_recommendations.py` reads those six and checks alias order inside each category row) |
| Generated public chain table | `docs/INSTALLATION.md` is not hand-edited: its marked region renders from `SHIPPED_MODEL_RECOMMENDATIONS` through `src/catalogs/model_chain_table.py`. Run `uv run python -m omh.cli docs chain-table` and add the new alias to `MODEL_DISPLAY_LABELS` there — the renderer raises with the key to add when it is missing |
| Pinned-chain and fallback-count tests | `tests/test_model_recommendations.py`, `tests/test_model_recommendation_routing.py`, `tests/test_model_routing_journey.py`, `tests/test_delegate_route_tool.py`, `tests/test_model_routing.py`, `tests/test_category_maestro.py`, `tests/test_task_scale_routing.py`, `tests/test_model_chains_command.py`, `tests/test_provider_entitlements.py` (chain-shaping cases), `tests/test_plugin_hermes_delegation.py` (route-provenance and reader fixtures name a chain member) — pins live in fixtures as well as assertions, so grep `tests/` for the old id and start the full suite in the background before the first doc edit, not after |
| Retired-alias list (an alias that left every chain but stays routable) | `_RECOGNITION_ONLY_ALIAS_FAMILIES` in `tests/test_provider_entitlements.py` |

| CLI help examples | `src/commands/coding.py` |

## 5. Price from documented list only

`APPROX_PRICE_PER_MTOK` takes the vendor's first-party list price with the
source and month in a comment. A model or tier without a documented price
gets no entry; absence renders no estimate. For an explicitly declared alias,
an exact user `model-prices.json` row wins first, then a base-contract row may
be inherited. Documented service-tier multipliers apply to inherited rates
(Astra Fast 2x, Flex 0.5x); a reasoning-mode label such as Astra Pro gets no
fabricated multiplier. Keep cached-input, cache-write, and long-context
caveats in the contract when the approximation table cannot represent them.
Check the existing family rows while you are there — the Claude 5 rows were
stale until the 5.1 pass.

## 6. Machine placement stays provider-neutral

Chains name model aliases, never providers. `~/.omh/routing/model-chains.json`
carries the order; `model-providers.json` says, per alias, which configured
provider serves it and under which wire id, and an alias with no row falls
back to Hermes' own provider resolution. Keep the two concerns apart: place
the new id in the chains through the CLI, and add a provider row only for an
alias that is genuinely served somewhere else than the default.

```sh
omh model-chains show
omh model-chains set architect "claude-fable-5-1:xhigh, claude-fable-5:xhigh, ..."
```

`dispatch-models.json` (the Claude Code profile's `--model`) is gated on the
CLI's own account, not on any provider; `providers.json` (the setup
interview's record of held providers and subscriptions) reorders chains per
machine, so a new id whose family no confirmed provider serves lands behind
the served entries automatically. Record which lane got the new id.
An id the resolving provider does not serve is not an error to hide: the
provider's rejection comes back as a normal result and the chain falls
through, which is exactly why the older generation stays behind the new one.

## 7. Prove it

Start the full suite in the background as soon as the chain edit lands and
keep editing docs while it runs; a chain change reaches fixtures in files the
table above cannot enumerate completely, and the suite is the only grep that
finds them all. Then a separate review lane (a read-only reviewer on the
diff) before the commit: the DeepSeek round's reviewer caught a reverse
projection that would have let a `-pro` / `-fast` / `-flex` alias label its
base id.

```sh
PYTHONPATH=tests uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
uv run python -m compileall -q src tests
uv run --group lint ruff check src tests
uv run python -m omh.cli coding model-contract-audit --inventory <fixture.json> --json
uv run python -m omh.cli docs workflows --check

uv run python -m omh.cli docs chain-table --check
uv run python -m omh.cli release drift
uv run --group lint ruff check src tests
git diff --check
```

## 8. Close with measurement

A calibration ships measurable. Name the baseline-vs-optimized benchmark
pair (old generation vs new, same task corpus, same effort) as the follow-up
when no served route exists yet. A calibration that measures worse than
baseline is revised or removed in the same change that reports the number.

An exact-model override has a second pair: `family` vs `optimized` on
`benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1` (`bench.py run --condition family`, then
`analyze.py --baseline-condition family`). The family arm sends the block the
model would inherit if the override did not exist, so the override is judged
against what it replaced, not only against no calibration. Pass rate alone
is the wrong yardstick on that corpus (every arm tends to tie); read the
paired token delta and, where the host records them, tool-call and turn
counts, because a counter for an "over-doing" trait shows up there first.

### The measurement recipe (2026-09-05, GPT-6 Astra)

The run that first exercised the family arm is the template. Each step is
one command or one read; the whole set is about 25 minutes per 30-task arm.

1. **Targeted manifest.** Copy `manifest.json`, keep the offline `fake`
   entry, replace the live entries with the one model at the effort its
   chain placement uses (Astra: `xhigh`). `analyze.py --manifest` reads the
   same file, so a one-model run is analysed without touching the canonical
   matrix.
2. **Smoke both conditions first** (`bench.py smoke`, one paid call each).
   A harness fault costs one call here and thirty later.
3. **Arms, in a recorded order.** `baseline`, `family`, `optimized`, each a
   separate `bench.py run --harness hermes_current_session --split evaluation
   --condition <arm> --max-paid-calls 30`. The harness runs one condition per
   invocation, so arm order is not counterbalanced within an arm; write the
   order down and keep every arm on the same day.
4. **Read cost, not only pass.** `analyze.py` gives the paired pass delta
   and McNemar; expect `p = 1.0`. Then read the per-instance token delta with
   a bootstrap CI, and pull `tool_call_count` and `api_call_count` for each
   arm's sessions from the Hermes `sessions` table (session ids carry the
   wall-clock start, so a run's rows are a contiguous window). Label those
   two counts out-of-harness in the report; the usage file on this path does
   not carry them.
5. **Know what "worse" looks like.** Astra's first override cost 10% more
   tokens than the family block for the same 18 / 30, with the excess in the
   two templates it failed anyway: the model kept working on tasks it would
   not pass. The clause with that reading ("carry them to completion instead
   of pausing") was replaced and the block re-measured back to family-block
   cost. Same pass, more tokens on failing tasks is the signature of a
   sentence that pushes; cut it, re-run, report both numbers.
6. **Measure effort before claiming it.** Astra at `low` produced the same
   pass set, tokens, and wall clock as `xhigh` on this corpus. An effort-tier
   claim needs its own arm.
7. **Archive the records outside git.** `benchmarks/*/artifacts/` is
   ignored; copy the `.jsonl` records, manifests, and scripts to a dated
   directory outside the repo and name it in the report, so the numbers in
   `MODEL_OPTI.md` and the benchmark README stay reproducible after the
   scratch space is gone.

What the corpus cannot say: no model passes its read or lsp templates, so
18 / 30 is the ceiling for every arm and a pass-rate gain cannot come from
it. Routing and calibration claims are cost and wall-clock claims here;
pass-rate claims need a corpus with headroom (#1333).

## 9. Report

PR body per the repo template: capability, motivation, boundary-level
implementation, observed verification (the commands above and their
outcome), risks (unserved ids, access-gated siblings, unmeasured
calibration). Commit trailers per `AGENTS.md`.
