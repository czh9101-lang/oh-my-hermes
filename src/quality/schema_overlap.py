"""Prompt/schema overlap probing for the omh tool surface: a candidate is never a delete.

A tool description is paid for in every context window that loads the toolset,
and part of it is often already carried by the JSON schema sitting beside it: a
parameter's type, its enum members, its clamp range, its default, whether it is
required. Text a reader could reconstruct from `(name, schema, blank outline)`
is a **prune candidate**. It is never an automatic delete, and this module
never removes anything -- it reports.

The bucketing, which is the actual doctrine:

**Prune candidates.** Parameter names and types. `required`. Value examples
that only restate an enum. Clamp ranges already declared as `minimum` /
`maximum`.

**Keep, always.** Defaults *and their direction* -- `gitignore: true` does not
say "respects gitignore", and the schema cannot say which way the boolean
points. Routing and escalation rules. Exact output shape. Worked anti-patterns.
Constraints the type system cannot express, such as a field required only for
one action.

Three caveats travel with the bucketing, and they are why the probe reports
rather than edits:

1. **One sample is noise.** A single overlap hit is a question, not a finding.
2. **`git blame` each line before cutting it.** Much of what looks redundant is
   incident scar tissue: someone added that sentence because a model got it
   wrong once.
3. **Memorization is not inference.** A model reconstructing text from a public
   repository may be reciting it. That caveat bounds the *model-based* probe the
   upstream audit describes; this module does not run one. It matches the
   schema against its own description deterministically, which is a narrower
   question with no recitation risk -- and a correspondingly narrower answer.

So the gate here is not "no overlap". It is **every overlap is classified**:
each finding must appear in `REVIEWED_OVERLAP_DECISIONS` with a verdict and a
reason, so a new tool description that restates its schema gets a human
decision rather than sliding in unread. Self-documenting flag-style tools prune
heavily; DSL and capability tools barely -- expect most verdicts to be `keep`.
