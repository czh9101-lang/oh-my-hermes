"""Per-skill instruction density for the catalog-rendered skill bodies.

`FULL_PROFILE_SKILL_BODY_CHAR_LIMIT` already ratchets how many bytes the whole
generated pack costs. It cannot tell a body that grew because a workflow gained
a rule from a body that grew because someone wrote three sentences where one
carried the instruction. This module measures the second thing: how much of a
skill body is payload a reader would act on.

Three signals, measured on the catalog producer (`builtin_skill_templates()`),
never on the committed `skills/*/SKILL.md` copies:

- ``filler_hits``: occurrences of the reviewed `FILLER_PHRASES` list. Each entry
  is a connective that can be deleted without losing a claim, a bound, or a
  condition.
- ``repeated_share_percent``: the share of a body's own sentence characters
  spent on the second and later copies of a sentence it already contains. This
  is intra-skill repetition; cross-skill repetition is a different cost and is
  already reported by `skills.context_cost`.
- ``payload_markers_per_1k``: never-delete payload per 1,000 prose characters.
  The marker list is the floor, not a style preference -- RFC 2119 modals,
  negation and exception words, conditionals, numeric bounds, and exact strings
  (identifiers, flags, paths) are the parts of an instruction that change what
  a reader does. Prose carrying few of them per character is prose that is
  describing rather than instructing.

Two surfaces are excluded from the prose on purpose. The frontmatter
`description` and the "Strong routing signals" list are *retrieval* surface:
they are matched against the user's own phrasing by `src/routing/`, so
keyword-redundant alternatives are payload there even where a human reader
needs only one. The body compresses; the trigger never does.
`compression_verdict()` enforces the same split for a proposed rewrite.
