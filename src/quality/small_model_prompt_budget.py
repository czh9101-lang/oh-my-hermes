"""Budget the prompt text every executor reads, including the weakest one.

A fanout unit prompt is not dispatched to one model. It is dispatched to
whatever local CLI the operator has: a frontier model on one lane and a kimi,
glm, qwen, codestral, or solar variant on the next. The per-family calibration
blocks already vary by family. The **shared preamble** does not -- it is the
byte-identical head every sibling prompt carries, deliberately, so providers can
cache the prefix.

That makes the shared head the one block that must be written for the *smallest*
model that will read it. A frontier model tolerates a dense head; a weaker one
starts dropping rules once a prompt carries more of them than it can hold, and
the rule it drops is not the one you would have picked. Every rule added to the
shared head is therefore paid for by displacing a rule already there, on exactly
the lanes least able to afford it.

Two things are measured here, and only two, because only two are honest:

- **A constraint ceiling on the shared head and on each block.** The upstream
  doctrine puts a tiny pattern-completer's limit at roughly 3-5 constraints
  before rules start displacing each other. OMH's consumers are coding-agent
  CLIs rather than tiny models, so that figure is a target, not the threshold:
  the ceilings below are the *measured* current values, which freezes the head
  where it is. Growing it then requires saying which existing rule the new one
  displaces, which is the decision the doctrine actually asks for. A byte
  ceiling rides alongside, because `UNIT_PROMPT_MAX_BYTES` bounds the whole
  assembled prompt and so lets the shared head triple without tripping.
- **No labelled contrast examples.** A block containing `Bad:` or `Wrong:`
  followed by a sample gets the sample copied rather than avoided by weaker
  models, which is the opposite of the intent. There are none today; this keeps
  it that way.

Two rules from the same doctrine are deliberately NOT mechanized. "Positive
framing only" would condemn text whose negations are the payload -- "do not
re-verify" is the entire anti-inertia rule, and rewriting it positively would
lose it. And "delete rules the code already enforces deterministically" needs a
judgement about what the code enforces, which no regex has. Both belong in
`MODEL_OPTI.md` as authoring rules, and they are there.
