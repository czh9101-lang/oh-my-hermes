"""Generated public projection of the shipped model recommendation chains.

`docs/INSTALLATION.md` publishes the shipped chains as a reader-facing table.
Before this module the table was hand-maintained: it agreed with
`SHIPPED_MODEL_RECOMMENDATIONS` only for as long as whoever retired a model
generation remembered to edit the doc too, and nothing failed when they did
not. Every other public projection of catalog data in this repository is byte-
or equality-gated, so this one was the exception.

The producer renders the whole marked region (markers included) from the
catalog, and `omh docs chain-table --check` compares bytes, which takes the
table out of human hands the same way the ULW regions are.

Two things the table shows do not exist as catalog data, so they live here and
only here:

- The display label for a model alias (`claude-fable-5-1` -> `Claude Fable
  5.1`). The alias is what routing uses; the label is what a reader needs.
- The "What it is for" phrase per surface. This is editorial one-line prose,
  and the same strings are already duplicated into `site/i18n.js` under the
  `chain.*` keys; source is the better home for them.

Both are required, not defaulted: a chain surface with no phrase, or a model
with no label, raises with the key to add and the command to rerun. A new
mixture category therefore cannot reach the shipped chains while staying
invisible in the public table — which is the point of the gate.

Effort is rendered from the catalog, never assumed, and always on the entry
that declares it. The hand-written table used a trailing token for a row whose
entries all shared an effort, which reads shorter but cannot be read back: in
`Claude Opus 5, GPT-5.6 Sol (medium)` the token could belong to the row or to
Sol alone, and for `last_resort.any` it belongs to Sol alone. One rule --
`Label (effort)` per entry, nothing at all for an entry that declares none --
is longer on the uniform rows and unambiguous on every row, which is what lets
`tests/test_model_chain_table.py` read the table back into aliases and efforts
and compare it against the catalog.
