"""Checked-in navigation policy for public documentation structure.

This declares three things and nothing else: which pages are entry points, which
pages must be reachable from one of them, and which pages are intentionally not
reachable and why. Every in-scope page is settled by exactly one of those, so an
accidentally orphaned page fails instead of blending into a silent allowlist.

Reachability here means discoverability through declared local Markdown links.
It is not information-architecture quality, accessibility, semantic accuracy, or
evidence that a page was published anywhere.
