"""One versioned contract for every place OMH caps captured output.

Each cap used to invent its own marker: ``"\\n...[truncated]"`` in the release
smoke report, ``"[output truncated at 16384-byte capture limit]"`` in the
Hermes-child stream drainer, and a bare tail slice with no marker at all in the
fanout verification runner. All three tell a reader that something was lost;
none of them says *why*, *how much*, or *where the rest is*. A consumer
therefore cannot tell "this is the whole output" from "more exists, capped
here", and a follow-up step has nothing to resolve.

Every truncation built here carries a machine-readable record instead: a reason
code from a closed vocabulary, the original byte count, the byte ranges that
were kept, and a continuation hint. When a spill store is offered the full
content is written whole to a content-addressed path and the record gains a
resolvable back-reference (path + sha256 + byte length), so a later step can
fetch exactly what was cut. The pointer is emitted only when the write actually
succeeded -- this repo's `prepared_not_observed` discipline applied to
artifacts.

No notice this module renders contains an ellipsis. A bare "..." is the shape
that started the problem: it is indistinguishable from an ellipsis the producer
wrote itself, and it carries no recovery path.
