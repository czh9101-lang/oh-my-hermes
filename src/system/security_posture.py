"""Named strict security posture: one switch that bundles the tightened end of
OMH's already-existing safety knobs, instead of an operator hand-tuning each
one across the setup profile.

`OMH_SECURITY=strict` follows the same env-resolution idiom `OMH_LANG` and
`OMH_HOME` already use: unset or blank reads as the safe, unchanged default,
and an unrecognized value is a loud `ValueError` naming the valid choices --
never a silent fallback, because a security knob that fails open on a typo is
worse than no knob at all.

`POSTURE_MAPPING` is the single table every tightened surface reads through.
Each row names the surface module, the value strict applies there, and a
short rationale -- it deliberately does NOT carry the default value: every
consuming surface already owns its default as a pre-existing constant, and
asking this module to restate it would create a second copy that could drift
from the original. `default` posture therefore changes nothing anywhere:
every surface's own constant is untouched, and this module is never consulted
for a value beyond the posture label itself.
