"""The editing model behind the chain picker, shared by its two surfaces.

Bare `omh model-chains` on a terminal and the Modern-TUI `/omh-model` widget
walk the same rows: one per shipped mixture category, each showing the chain
in effect, whether it is a shipped default or an override, and whether this
machine's confirmed providers serve its head. Left and right step the head
model through the known aliases, minus and plus step the head's reasoning
effort, and a save composes the override document exactly the way
`omh model-chains set` composes it. This module holds every one of those
rules so neither surface carries chain logic of its own; it renders nothing
and reads no keys.

The widget imports this module from the installed plugin bundle, so it may
depend only on siblings in this package. Display labels and purpose phrases
live in the repo's catalog module, which the bundle cannot see; `picker_rows`
takes them as optional mappings and falls back to the raw alias — the name
routing actually uses — so a surface without the catalog still shows the
truth, just less prettily.
