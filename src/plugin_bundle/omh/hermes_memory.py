"""Read what Hermes actually remembers, not just how large the file is.

Hermes keeps its built-in memory in ``~/.hermes/memories/MEMORY.md`` and
``USER.md`` as a ``§``-delimited entry list, and enforces a *character* cap per
file on write (``hermes-agent/tools/memory_tool.py``). OMH's advisory lane used
``stat().st_size`` for that comparison, which is a different unit: UTF-8 spends
three bytes on a Hangul syllable, so a Korean MEMORY.md reads about 1.2x its own
length. A 1,933-character file reports as ``2347 bytes (cap ~2200)`` and looks
over budget while Hermes still accepts writes. An ASCII file of the same length
reports correctly, which is why the mismatch went unnoticed.

Counting characters fixes the unit. Splitting the entries is what lets the rest
of OMH say *which* entry is stale or already duplicated in its own store,
instead of only how full the file is.

The cap itself is read rather than assumed. Hermes takes it from
``memory.memory_char_limit`` / ``memory.user_char_limit`` in ``config.yaml`` and
only falls back to 2200/1375, so hardcoding those two numbers reported a raised
limit as exhausted headroom on any host that had changed them. Each reading
carries the cap it was measured against and whether that cap was observed in
config or assumed.

Read-only by construction: nothing here opens a file for writing. Hermes owns
these files, and the `memory` tool it exposes to the model is the surface that
edits them.
