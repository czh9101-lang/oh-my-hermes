"""Realtime voice trial receipts (`realtime_voice_trial_receipt/v1`, issue #1426).

A voice connector that authenticates and returns audio has proven almost
nothing. It can still clip the first syllable of every utterance, cut one
sentence into two turns or glue two into one, dispatch a transcript that was
never finished, take four seconds to make a sound, start its answer over from
the beginning after a streaming fallback, ignore an interruption, or hand an
ambiguous spoken phrase to a tool that spends money. Generic connector success
and one audio artifact cannot tell those apart, so this contract asks for the
milestones that can.

Three separations do the work here, and none of them collapses into another:

- **Turn integrity is not latency.** A turn whose milestones are complete and
  in order can still be a split turn, a double dispatch, or a truncated input.
  Integrity is checked per turn from named states; latency is *derived* and
  only for turns that earned it -- one declared timing reference, every
  required milestone present, and a segmentation that nobody split or merged.
  A turn without those reports no latency at all rather than a plausible number.
- **Requested is not observed.** Every trial names the stack it asked for and,
  separately, the stack the host actually saw. When the host measured nothing,
  `observed_stack_evidence` is `unavailable` and the observed block must be
  empty -- echoing the requested model into it is refused, because a receipt
  that cannot tell the two apart is how a request becomes a result.
- **Synthetic is not the room.** A fixture proves the wiring; it does not prove
  the room, the microphone, the network, or the telephony path. A synthetic
  trial's verdict is capped at `hold`, and an actual-environment trial whose
  facets were not all the intended ones is capped the same way, with the
  missing facets named.

The contract is provider-neutral by construction. Providers, models, voices,
transports, codecs, endpoint detectors, and fallback paths are opaque
references a host or connector supplies; nothing here branches on any of them.
OMH opens no microphone, call, room, socket, or provider session, downloads no
model, installs no connector, and authorizes no tool. A receipt is an
observation somebody else made, validated and summarized.

Conversational content stays out by construction rather than by redaction. The
key set is closed, so there is no field a transcript, a raw tool argument, a
provider payload, or a recording could arrive in, and every free string is
screened for raw phone numbers, addresses, and credential shapes before it is
accepted.
