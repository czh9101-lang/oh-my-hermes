"""Point-in-time web evidence receipts (`temporal_source_receipt/v1`, issue #1403).

A research answer about "what was known as of a date" is only as good as the
proof that a page held its cited text at or before that date. Three clocks are
involved, and none of them stands in for another:

- **capture time** -- when an archive or capture provider observed the page.
  It is the only clock that can bound a historical claim, and it is always
  provider-reported: a receipt attributes it, it never authenticates it.
- **publication time** -- what the page says about itself. A self-reported
  date proves neither that the page existed nor that it was unchanged before
  the cutoff, so it never appears on a receipt at all.
- **retrieval time** -- when Hermes or a wrapper fetched the capture or the
  live page. It dates the observation, not the content.

A receipt binds one cited source to one requested `as_of` date or interval and
says which of two evidence surfaces the cited text came from: a historical
capture, or the live page. The two are typed apart on purpose. A live page is
valid *current* evidence and never historical evidence, whatever its
publication date says, so a receipt that presents one as historical is refused
rather than merely ineligible.

Eligibility is one predicate, `receipt_supports_as_of_claim`: an available
historical capture whose provider-reported capture time is at or before the
cutoff and which carries a stable capture identifier or content digest. A
receipt that fails it is still a valid record -- an unavailable capture, an
exhausted paid provider, or a capture whose time the provider did not report
are all facts worth keeping -- but the claim it would back moves to the
unresolved annex as a `temporal_retrieval_gap/v1`. Nothing here reaches the
network: the gap states that no retrieval was performed, and a missing archive
or spent provider authority is reported, never worked around.

The contract is provider-neutral. `capture_provider` is an opaque identity an
installed native tool or an external archive connector supplies; OMH installs
nothing, infers no credentials, and treats a receipt as prepared research
context rather than proof that anything was fetched.
