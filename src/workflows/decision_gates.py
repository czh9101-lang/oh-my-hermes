"""Append-only decision gates: one question, one answer, one released transition (issue #825).

What was missing
----------------

OMH could already stop work and say why. `coding.action_gate` withholds an
action pending approval, `workflows.approval_receipts` records the consent an
operator gave, and `workflows.blocked_work_records` keeps the decision
explainable after the turn. What none of them holds is the *question*: which
one thing a human is being asked right now, which choices they have, what each
choice costs, and -- the part that survives nothing today -- exactly which
blocked transition their answer releases.

Without that, a pause is durable and a resume is not. The gate is reconstructed
from whatever the next turn happens to remember, so an answer given to one
question can be applied to a different one, and a restart between the question
and the answer loses the binding entirely.

Why this is its own record family
---------------------------------

The repo refused a new family twice (#811, #818) and accepted three (#807,
#808/#806, #826) on a rule worth restating: a family joins on run id, and a join
is where an artifact and its metadata desynchronize, so a field group on the
record that already exists is the default. A separate family has to earn it.

This one earns it on the same dimensions #807 used, and it earns it hardest
against the family it looks most like. An approval receipt records *an answer
that was given*. It has no shape for a question that has not been answered yet:
`APPROVAL_DECISIONS` is `granted`/`denied`/`revoked`, all three of them past
tense, and there is deliberately no `pending` member -- an unanswered
confirmation must not sit in the approval store looking like a weak grant. A
decision gate is the other half: it exists *before* the answer, which is the
whole of what "durable and resumable" means here, and it is written by the
surface that blocked rather than by the operator who answers.

It is also bound to something an approval is not bound to. An approval binds
five dimensions of a *request*. A gate additionally binds the *position* the run
is paused at -- the blocked transition and the checkpoint -- because releasing
the wrong transition on a correct subject is the failure mode #825 AC3 names.

Coexisting with the name that was already here
----------------------------------------------

`decision_gate` was already a live string in this tree, in two unrelated places,
and neither of them is this:

* `catalogs.playbooks` names three wrapper stages whose declared artifact
  contract is `decision_gate/v1` (`decision_gate`, `delivery_decision`,
  `deploy_decision`). That string named a kind of evidence with no schema behind
  it. This module is that schema, arriving under the name those stages have been
  citing all along, which is why the version string here is `decision_gate/v1`
  and not a second spelling of it.
* `workflows.hermes_planning._wrapper_contract` carries a `decision_gate`
  sub-dict -- `required` / `condition` / `do_not_delegate_when`. That is a
  *contract clause*, not a record: it tells a wrapper the conditions under which
  a prepared plan may be delegated, it is rebuilt from the plan on every call,
  it names no subject, no approver, and no answer, and nothing about it survives
  the turn. It is deliberately left alone. `tests/test_decision_gate.py` pins the
  two apart so a later reader cannot collapse them.

What a gate binds, and what releases it
---------------------------------------

A resume is matched on equality across four groups, each with its own refusal
code, and the codes are `approval_receipts`' own rather than a parallel set:

    run_id                              -> run_not_approved
    (subject_class, subject_ref)        -> scope_not_approved
    (safety_profile_revision,
     context_revision)                  -> safety_revision_not_approved
    (blocked_transition, checkpoint_ref)-> transition_not_unblocked

The first three are `SCOPE_REFUSAL_CODES` members, reused because "this answer
does not cover you" already has a vocabulary in this tree and a second one would
be a second answer to the same question. The fourth is this family's own,
because no existing code says "right subject, wrong place in the run".

`resume_digest` is the single value that seals all seven of those fields at
once. It is re-derived at validate, so a hand-edited store cannot move an answer
onto a transition it was never given for, and it is what a caller cites when it
says which resume it is performing.

There is no containment rule anywhere in this module. Matching is equality on
every dimension, which is what makes widening structurally impossible rather
than merely unimplemented.

One open gate per subject
-------------------------

#825 AC1 is that a blocked workflow identifies *one* open gate. That is enforced
in both directions rather than left to a renderer: `open_decision_gate` refuses
to open a second gate while another is open for the same subject, and
`validate_decision_gate_store` faults a store that already holds two, so a
hand-edited or concurrently written store fails `omh runtime validate` instead
of presenting an operator with two questions and no rule for which one their
answer belongs to.

Nothing here can carry a sentence
---------------------------------

The key set is closed, `RAW_OR_HIDDEN_KEYS` is refused by name first, and there
is no free-text field -- not for the question, not for the risk, not for a
choice's consequence. Every one of those is a closed vocabulary id whose prose
is a module constant joined at render, the idiom `approval_receipts.REFUSAL_REASONS`
and `run_lineage.BREAK_REASONS` already use. A gate is rendered to an operator
who is about to authorise something, so the text they read must be text this
repo wrote, never text that arrived with the request.

An answered gate is not evidence
--------------------------------

`CLAIM_BOUNDARY` is on every record and `validate_decision_gate` refuses a record
shaped to assert execution by key name as well as by the closed key set. Choosing
`approve` proves a human chose it. It does not prove the transition was taken,
and it never proves anything ran.

Determinism
-----------

`resume_digest` covers no clock. `opened_at` and `decided_at` are parameters, and
freshness is recomputed by every reader from the stored stamp against a `now`
that is passed in -- the `approval_receipts` idiom, reusing that module's
`APPROVAL_TTL_SECONDS` and `approval_age_seconds` rather than declaring a second
window. Nothing on disk says a decision is still good.

Store mechanics
---------------

All of it is `system.append_only_store`, shared with the four families beside it:
the torn-tail-safe binary append under a real OS lock on both platforms, the
opaque-reference guards, the digest handles, and the chain walk. This module adds
no store mechanics of its own.

What produces and reads these records today
-------------------------------------------

Stated because the vocabularies here are wider than the wiring, and a reader who
took `QUESTION_CODES` for a coverage claim would be wrong. No production surface
mints a gate yet: `coding.action_gate` still withholds an action without opening
one, exactly as `run_lineage` shipped its chain before anything appended to it.
The one production read surface is `runtime.artifacts.validate_runtime`, which
carries this store's integrity -- including the one-open-gate rule -- into
`omh runtime validate`.
