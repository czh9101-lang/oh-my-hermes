"""Append-only receipts for external effects an acting surface actually observed.

An external effect is something that happened outside this machine: a message
that reached a chat platform, a review that landed on a change, a CI run that
executed, a merge that moved a branch. OMH performs none of them. It can only
record that a surface which *does* act observed one, and a receipt is that
record.

The store is therefore mint-restricted, in the same shape as the
prepared-vs-observed handshake in `adapter_quality`:

- `build_external_effect_receipt` refuses `observed_result="requested"`
  outright, and every producer refuses to mint from a record whose own
  `observed` flag is false, so no prepared, requested, or merely intended
  record can become a receipt.
- `requested` and `attempted` are reportable states that are *projected* over
  the absence of a receipt for an effect a run asked for (`PROJECTED_RESULTS`).
  They are never minted from an unobserved record.
- `acting_surface` is a closed vocabulary of surfaces that already require
  observed evidence before they write. There is no free-text surface and no
  CLI that mints a receipt from operator input.
- `succeeded` requires a non-empty `external_ref`. A surface that observed
  success but cannot name what it succeeded at records `unknown`, because an
  unnameable success is not a citable one.

Retries and reversals link (`supersedes_receipt_ref`) instead of overwriting.
The store is a JSONL file appended under `file_lock`, whose OS lock is real on
both POSIX and Windows, so history is structurally immutable on either. A short
write that leaves a partial line cannot swallow the next record: the append
terminates an unterminated tail before writing.

Everything on a receipt is metadata: bounded identifiers, a closed-vocabulary
result, and one redacted summary line. No prompt, payload, transcript, URL, or
filesystem path can be stored, and `validate_external_effect_receipt` rejects
the key names those arrive under as well as the shapes they arrive in.

The guards are declared by field *class* rather than by field name (see the
class tables beside `EXTERNAL_EFFECT_RECEIPT_KEYS`) and applied in all three
places a receipt is handled -- built, validated, and rendered -- because a guard
that covers the fields someone thought of is how the next field arrives without
one.

One predicate, `receipt_satisfies_success_claim`, decides whether a receipt
backs a success claim, and one selector, `select_effect_receipt`, decides which
receipt that predicate is asked about. Runtime validation and the claim ladder
call both, so the two can never disagree about what a receipt proves or judge
different receipts for the same effect.
