"""Trigger language packs: the mechanism that makes any input language addable.

A skill's trigger phrases are how a deterministic router recognises what a
person typed. Those phrases used to exist only as source literals, so the set
of languages OMH could recognise was whatever the source happened to contain,
and reaching a new one meant editing `src/skills/catalog_definitions.py`. That
is a hardcoded language list wearing a data structure, and it makes every
language after the first two somebody else's pull request.

A trigger language pack is that same phrase table as validated data: one JSON
document per language, mapping a skill id to the phrases speakers of that
language actually type for it. Two sources merge deterministically:

* Repo-shipped packs in `omh.routing.trigger_packs` (`<lang>.json`). These are
  part of the product, so they merge into the catalog itself and every surface
  built from it -- scoring, the rendered `SKILL.md` trigger lists, the
  generated workflow docs -- sees exactly one trigger table.
* User packs under `<omh-home>/routing/trigger-packs/<lang>.json`, following
  the `routing/model-chains.json` precedent. These merge at the scoring layer
  only: a local pack changes what your router recognises, and never rewrites
  the product's generated artifacts, so the repo's byte gates stay a property
  of the repo rather than of whoever runs them.

Validation is strict, atomic, and loud. A pack naming a skill id that does not
exist is invalid rather than silently dropped, because a silently-dropped entry
is indistinguishable from a phrase that quietly pulls unrelated requests toward
the wrong lane. A phrase or hold-back entry that normalizes away to nothing is
invalid too: that is the #1188 lesson generalized -- an entry written in
composed Hangul that the NFKD-folding matcher can never see is dead weight the
author believes is live, and a dead entry in *any* language should fail at
authoring time rather than at routing time.

Everything here is pure: reading JSON files off disk and folding strings. No
network, no dependency, no model.
