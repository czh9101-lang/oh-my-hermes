"""Permanent alias routing for the four retired ULW engines (#954 stage 5).

`team`, `ultraprocess`, `ralph`, and `ultragoal` retired from the routable
surface with a window=0 maintainer decision: their natural-language cues route
permanently to `ultrawork`'s matching internal capability instead of passing
through an alias or warning release stage. The original invocation is
preserved in diagnostics (`alias_resolution.original_invocation`) with a
one-line `capability_reason` that states the Hermes-harness default in the
same words the orchestration vocabulary uses (#953).

The Codex-named cue cluster from the old `ultraprocess` trigger table is
deliberately NOT an engine alias (plan Q9): naming a coding CLI is an
owner-choice signal, not an engine-selection signal, and carrying it onto
`ultrawork` would encode Codex as the implicit default engine. Those cues
resolve through the owner-selection path instead; the in-message-naming
provenance writer (#953, PR A) records the naming as an explicit choice.

Copy here is informational migration copy, never a deprecation warning: the
intent now runs as `ulw-work`'s capability, permanently.
