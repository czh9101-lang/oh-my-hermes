"""Deterministic segmentation of a compound outcome request (issue #816).

A compound request asks for more than one outcome in one message: "research the
payment providers, write the migration plan, and implement the winner". The
router scores one message against one skill and returns the single best match,
so handing it that whole sentence returns `research` and silently drops the
other two outcomes. Composing a multi-step workflow needs the parts.

Why a positional split rather than `contains_cue_phrase`
--------------------------------------------------------

`contains_cue_phrase` answers whether a declared phrase is present. It cannot
say where, and it is deliberately unanchored: it matches `and` inside
`understand`. A splitter needs both properties it lacks -- the offsets, and word
boundaries so a connector living inside a word is not treated as a separator.
So the connector table is declared here the way every other cue table in this
package is declared, and it is matched with a boundary-anchored pattern built
from that same table rather than with ad hoc `in` checks scattered through the
code. The two token helpers keep the parts they own: `routing_tokens` decides
whether a fragment carries enough signal to be a segment at all, and
`normalized_phrase` collapses fragments that differ only by case or Unicode
form.

Splitting is deliberately generous and the verdict is deliberately strict.
Over-splitting costs one extra cached recommendation lookup per fragment;
under-splitting loses an outcome the user asked for. Whether the request is
actually compound is not decided here -- that needs the capability families the
fragments resolve to, which lives in `omh.workflows.workflow_composition`.

Language
--------

The connectors are English only, following the Routing Language Policy in
`docs/DIRECTION.md`: English is the precision target, and per-language trigger
tables do not scale to the languages a global product must serve. A Korean or
Japanese compound request therefore reads as one segment here, which surfaces
downstream as `not_compound` -- a visible gap rather than a wrong composition.
