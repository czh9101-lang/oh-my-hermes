    actually has instead of asking blind; the full report stays behind
    `omh coding model-inventory`.

    Each candidate's stored readiness goes through the same freshness rule the
    probe applies (#837), so a decision that no longer describes this machine
    reads `stale` here too. Ranking a candidate whose CLI is gone to the top of
    the choose-executor card is the failure that rule exists to prevent.

    `plan` is the accepted plan's declared fields (#810). When one is supplied,
    each candidate also carries its owner-fit verdict and the required
    capabilities recorded unavailable for it, and fit becomes the FIRST ranking
    key — an owner that cannot do the work must never head this card, whatever
    its login marker says. Candidates are still never removed: the card offers
    what the user may pick, and the verdict says what each pick would cost.
