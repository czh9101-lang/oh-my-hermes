"""The orchestration vocabulary contract for Hermes-native coding delivery.

This module is a data contract, not a dispatch system — the same shape as
`model_routing.py`: pure data plus one payload function, no I/O, no clock, no
environment reads, no new dependency. It pins the nine terms that separate the
Hermes harness, the Hermes mixture-of-model path, and Maestro so routing copy,
cards, and docs stop blending them. Nothing here selects an executor and
nothing here prepares or dispatches a handoff.

Two facts the entries state and must not overclaim:

- ``claude-code`` is prompt-only on the Maestro RECORD axis. OMH prepares a
  prompt handoff for Claude Code and never runs it from that path, so the
  Maestro entry says "prepares a handoff for" and never claims it as the
  thing that runs the work. Execution is a separate, explicit axis: the
  fanout dispatch bridge (`omh coding fanout dispatch`, and its `omh coding
  run` single-run entry) already spawns local agent CLIs -- including
  claude-code -- as its own operator-invoked, per-invocation opt-in. A
  prepared prompt handoff and a bridge dispatch are two different records;
  neither claim substitutes for the other.
- Mixture and Maestro never share subagent-unit language. Mixture binds a
  model per role to Hermes subagents inside one harness; Maestro hands an
  external coding CLI the work after an explicit user choice.
