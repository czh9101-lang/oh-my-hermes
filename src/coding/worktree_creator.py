"""Worktree observation ledger helpers.

OMH does not create Git worktrees for chat-prepared handoffs. Upstream Hermes
Agent manages worktrees natively (Kanban worktree-per-task since v0.15.0,
Desktop Projects since v0.18.0), so a chat-side creation path is redundant and
can collide with the worktree Hermes is already managing for the same task.
This module retains the observation-side helpers (reading the local worktree
ledger, recording observed worktree evidence) plus one scoped exception:
`ensure_fanout_unit_worktree`, used only by the explicit opt-in
`omh coding fanout dispatch` bridge, which needs one isolated worktree per
fanout unit before spawning a local agent CLI. Worktrees are never
auto-deleted.
