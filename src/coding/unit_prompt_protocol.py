"""Verification discipline for prepared fanout unit prompts.

Six deterministic text blocks ride every dispatched unit prompt:

1. **Goal echo-back** — before any tool use the subagent restates the goal,
   its own deliverable, and the completion criteria, and stops to report (not
   guess) if its reading conflicts with the declared boundary.
2. **Pre-declared completion criteria** — "done" is defined BEFORE work
   starts, as a numbered list derived from the unit contract, so completion
   is a check against stated criteria rather than a feeling.
3. **Verification stop conditions** — verification is mandatory (exactly one
   full pass is the floor, never skipped) and bounded (after the criteria
   pass, re-verifying is forbidden; on failure, at most two fix-and-verify
   cycles before reporting the failing criterion instead of looping).
4. **Failure-kind discipline** — a permission, sandbox, or policy denial is
   a boundary, not a bug (never retried through another route), and
   "blocked" requires a named concrete condition that survives the bounded
   fix cycles — difficulty, uncertainty, or remaining work is not blocked.
5. **Structured return** — the unit's final report ends with one fenced
   JSON object in the `fanout_unit_result/v1` expected-evidence shape. The
   sidecar file is the primary machine-read return; when a contracted
   sidecar is missing the collector parses this block from captured stdout
   and validates it the same way, so collection is parse-then-validate on
   either path and never prose-scraping.
6. **Capped structural search** — code exploration is bounded the same way
   verification is: a few targeted structural-search-or-grep passes before a
   full-file read, escalating only when a bounded pass finds nothing or stays
   ambiguous, and stopping the moment the target is found. Shared verbatim
   with the `executor_prompting_contract/v1` payload's
   `structural_search_discipline` field (`.coding_contracts.
   STRUCTURAL_SEARCH_DISCIPLINE_GUIDANCE`) so the two cannot drift.

The blocks split across two placement zones for prompt-cache hygiene: the
goal echo-back, verification-stop, failure-kind, structured-return, and
capped-search blocks are unit-invariant,
so `shared_unit_preamble_lines()` places them (with the overall goal) at the
byte-identical head every sibling prompt of one fanout shares, and
`unit_protocol_lines()` carries only the unit-varying remainder — numbered
criteria, role protocol, calibration, and the domain bundle. Every major
serving stack caches prompt prefixes by exact bytes, so sibling prompts that
share their head let the first dispatch write the cache the rest read; the
rule itself ships as `PROMPT_CACHE_COMPOSITION_PROTOCOL`.

High-effort routes additionally get a per-family calibration block that
counters the known over-verification inertia of strong reasoning models.
Calibration is keyed by model family and selected only when the routed
reasoning effort is in the high tier; families the table has not met get the
generic block — no family carries richer guidance than another without a
stated reason, and no vendor is privileged.

Everything here is pure data and pure functions: the blocks land in prepared
prompts (subprocess argv), so the total prompt size is policy-gated by
`UNIT_PROMPT_MAX_BYTES` in tests rather than trimmed at runtime.
