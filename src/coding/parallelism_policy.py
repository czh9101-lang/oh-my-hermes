"""Execution-concurrency policy for the opt-in fanout dispatch path.

Defaults mirror OMO's task engine (per-lane default 5, global ceiling 8) on
owner direction. Every value is a setup-profile tunable under `parallelism`,
read with the same validated-override-plus-disclosure shape as the memory
policy's cadence block: an invalid stored value falls back to the default
and is named in `ignored_keys` instead of failing the read or silently
winning. OMH core still makes no LLM or network calls — this policy only
sizes the explicit `omh coding fanout dispatch` subprocess pool and its
per-owner lanes, and states the advisory lane budget a Hermes-native run
may read; it never patches Hermes and never enforces anything there.

The same block also carries the spawn guard — `max_depth` and
`run_spawn_ceiling` — because both bound the same one subprocess exception
from a different direction: the pool width bounds how many units run at once,
the ceiling bounds how many are ever started, and the depth cap bounds whether
a dispatched agent CLI may dispatch again at all. `max_retries` rides along
for the same reason, sized by `fanout_retry.FANOUT_MAX_RETRIES`.

`read_parallelism_policy` applies the active `OMH_SECURITY` posture last, on
top of the stored profile: `default` changes nothing, `strict` clamps every
tunable here (and `max_retries`) to the ceiling named in
`system.security_posture.POSTURE_MAPPING`, disclosed the same
clamp-and-name way an out-of-range profile value already is.
