"""Exact-model contracts and bounded declared inheritance.

A contract is prepared metadata — the vendor's published effort vocabulary,
limits, tool-calling surface, pricing, and runtime mechanisms for one exact
model id, each with the page it was read from. It is consulted by the route
resolver (to keep a documented-unsupported effort from reaching a provider
silently) and printed by `omh coding model-contract`. It never proves that a
provider serves the model to this account, that a runtime implements any of
the mechanisms named here, or that a route ran.

Contracts are keyed by exact model id after the provider prefix is stripped.
Provider catalogs may expose a bounded set of declared mode/service-tier aliases
for one contract. Those aliases resolve only through the explicit projection
table below; arbitrary suffix stripping is forbidden. A model without an exact
or declared contract gets `None`, never a guess.
