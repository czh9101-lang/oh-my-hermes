"""Which account one coding owner's CLI is logged in as, as a redacted tag.

A limit-shaped failure is an account fact. Without knowing WHICH account hit
the limit, the only recovery omh can offer is "wait", and the operator who has
already switched accounts is told to wait for a window that no longer applies
to them. The 2026-09-11 incident ended on `session limit · resets 6:10pm` with
nothing recorded about whose session it was.

What is read, and only this:

- `claude-code`: `~/.claude.json` -> `oauthAccount.emailAddress`, falling back
  to `oauthAccount.accountUuid`, falling back to the presence of the single
  `claudeAiOauth` slot in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. That file holds one
  OAuth slot and nothing else, so its presence says an account is logged in
  without saying which.
- `codex`: `~/.codex/auth.json` -> `tokens.account_id`, falling back to whether
  an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured there.

What is never read: any token, key, or secret value. `accessToken`,
`refreshToken`, `id_token`, and the API key's own value are never opened, never
hashed, and never persisted. The only inputs to a tag are an email address, an
account uuid, and an account id — identifiers, not credentials.

Redaction. An email becomes the first two characters of its local part, an
ellipsis, and its domain (`kh...@gmail.com`): stable across runs, enough for an
operator to recognise their own account, and not the address itself. Every
other identifier becomes the first 8 hex characters of its SHA-256, which is
one-way and stable. The tag is prefixed with the owner's family (`claude:` /
`codex:`) so two owners' tags can never compare equal by accident.

Two tags being EQUAL is the claim this module is for: it is what says a limit
was hit under the account that is still configured. Two tags being equal is
never a claim that the accounts are the same person, and an empty tag is never
a claim that nobody is logged in -- it says only that nothing readable named an
account. `cause_recovery` treats an empty tag as "cannot be shown to have
changed", which is the conservative direction.

Reads only. Nothing here writes to the operator's home directory, and no
failure propagates: an unreadable, absent, or unparseable file is an empty tag.
