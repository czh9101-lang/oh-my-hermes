"""Execution states of one dispatched unit, kept apart from process liveness.

A unit's process being alive says nothing about whether its work is moving.
The 2026-09-11 incident had a worker alive for 36 minutes, retrying the same
git workaround, while the supervisor read "PID alive" as progress. These
states name what OMH has actually observed about the WORK, so that every
surface (inflight markers, status board, run summary, reminders) says the
same thing and none of them renders "alive" as "progressing".
