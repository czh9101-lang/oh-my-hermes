"""Reap fanout unit process groups — marker-verified pids only.

`omh coding fanout dispatch` spawns each unit as its own process group and
records the leader pid in the unit's inflight marker. When the dispatcher
dies without running its cleanup (SIGKILL, power loss), those groups can
survive against the worktree with a marker left behind — including the
shape OMO shipped as an incident, where the LEADER is already gone but its
grandchildren live on in the group. This reaper therefore judges liveness
at the GROUP level, and terminates ONLY pids an inflight marker names:

- a pid no marker names is refused, whatever its process name says — there
  is deliberately no pattern-matching kill (OMO's `doctor --reap` carries
  the same constraint);
- a live leader that is no longer its own group leader is refused as a
  recycled pid;
- markers are cleared only once the whole group is gone.

The reaper does not check that the dispatcher is dead: every marker-named
group is fair game, including a live dispatcher's running units — verify
the dispatcher first. It adds remediation, not a liveness claim; the
marker's presence-is-not-liveness boundary is untouched. Known limit: a
dispatcher killed between spawn and the marker's pid write leaves an
orphan no marker names, which this module refuses by design.
