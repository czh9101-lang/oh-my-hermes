"""Canonical `lifecycle-growth` skill data (issue #1374).

One `SkillDefinition` instance, `DEFINITION`, holding pure catalog data for the
lifecycle-growth workflow: routing triggers, required inputs with their
clarification questions, the six versioned artifact names, and the ordered
progressive-disclosure procedure the existing renderer turns into
`references/procedure.md`.

`catalog_definitions.py` imports this module as the single installed definition
source. Its artifacts guide human review and handoff; runtime operations are exposed through the
canonical `omh runtime workflow-artifact lifecycle-growth <operation>` interface.
The launch-review operations `audience`, `promote`, and `graduate` (issue #1399)
return separate versioned records and do not change the six artifacts below.

Concept-level prior art (pinned, MIT outside enterprise directories; no code
copied, no integration adopted): PostHog `ae880d30` for actual-display exposure,
launch/pause/stop controls, ordered audience reachability, read-only promotion
preflight, separate post-rollout gate cleanup, and deleted-reference/no-data
evaluation classes (issue #1399 review; `docs/SKILL-SOURCES.md` records the
five community commits), GrowthBook `095f6164` for sticky assignment,
guardrails, minimum runtime, the ship/rollback/review/insufficient-data
vocabulary, and the analysis-run state distinction that keeps queued, running,
failed, canceled, and never-started work apart from a missing result (issue
#1429), Dittofeed `52b2bee9` for entry/exit, re-entry, and idempotency,
Novu `c7bc772f` for preference precedence, digest/throttle windows, throttle
grouping identity, per-step matched/skipped tracing, and production read-only
workflow content (issue #1400).
