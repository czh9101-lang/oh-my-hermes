"""Canonical `decision-prototype` skill data (issue #1371).

Pure catalog data. This module exports one `SkillDefinition` for the bounded

disposable, isolated experiment whose observed result feeds planning without

`catalog_definitions.py` imports this module as the single installed definition
source. It describes bounded human or executor-guided work only; it does not
execute, validate, or persist an artifact.
