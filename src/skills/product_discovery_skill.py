"""Canonical catalog data for the `product-discovery-validation` workflow (issue #1375).

This module holds one ``SkillDefinition`` and nothing else. It is the canonical
installed source imported by ``catalog_definitions.py``: no routing logic,
artifact builders, or validators live here. Use the canonical
`omh runtime workflow-artifact product-discovery-validation <operation>` interface
for metadata-only builds, gates, and handoffs.

Concept-level sources, adapted with attribution and without copying code:

- GitLab Product Development Flow, handbook revision ``4165803c`` (MIT):
  a validation track separated from build, with a problem gate before solution
  work.
- Mycelium ``8d6d5315`` (MIT): evidence source classes, external-human gates,
  falsification propagation, and precommitted assumption tests.
- Claude Code Discover ``a414fc7a`` (MIT): explicit hypothesis states, the
  smallest disconfirming test, hard budgets, and honest inconclusive results.
- Product Pipeline Public ``a0997741`` (MIT): persistent hypotheses, evidence
  typing, decision history, and contradiction flags.
- PM Skills ``18468a95`` (MIT): assumption categories, past-behavior
  interviews, demand tests, and beachhead/ICP framing.

None of those projects' hooks, schemas, runtimes, or vendor integrations are
adopted here.
