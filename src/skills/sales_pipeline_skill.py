"""Canonical `sales-pipeline-review` skill data for issue #1376.

This module exports the canonical installed definition imported by
`catalog_definitions.py`. Its artifact names guide a human review and handoff;
the canonical operator surface is `omh runtime workflow-artifact
sales-pipeline-review <operation>`; no CRM mutation, storage, sync, alert,
outreach, or delivery is performed.

Triggers are English only. The three narrow Korean phrases live in
`src/routing/trigger_packs/ko.json`, not in this canonical definition.

Concept-level prior art (no code copied, no vendor integration adopted): the
GitLab Handbook sales stage/exit-criteria, coverage, aging, forecast-accuracy and
renewal-review material (MIT, `4165803c`), Odoo `crm_lead` field semantics
(LGPL-3.0, `1a13ceea`), the ERPNext `opportunity` doctype (GPL-3.0, `72fa7d0b`),
and Twenty's opportunity entity (AGPL-3.0 with exceptions, `c8fc7665`) were read
as data-model observations only.
