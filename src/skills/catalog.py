"""Assembles the OMH skill catalog and serves it.

The catalog is built by ordered mutation, and that order is the point: the
hand-written definitions come first, then the standalone quality-evidence skill,
then the feature-surface skills, then the native-capability skills. Consumers see
that order in `builtin_definitions()`, and the generated docs and skill files are
byte-compared against it, so reordering this file changes committed artifacts.

The data itself lives next door - `catalog_types` (what a skill is),
`catalog_definitions` (the hand-written skills), `catalog_feature_surfaces`
(template-built skills), and `catalog_harnesses` (runtime contracts). This module
is the assembly and the public surface: every accessor other code imports.

    Hermes derives a skill's category from DIRECTORY STRUCTURE, not from
    frontmatter: `tools/skills_tool.py::_get_category_from_path` takes the path
    relative to each configured skills dir and uses the first path component
    only when the relative path has three or more parts. A flat
    `<skills_dir>/<skill>/SKILL.md` install therefore resolves to no category at
    all, and the startup banner filed every OMH skill under "general". Installs
    are nested one level deeper -- `<skills_dir>/<category>/<skill>/SKILL.md` --
    so the group a reader sees is a group OMH chose.

    The group is deliberately NOT `SkillDefinition.category`. That field is the
    catalog's fine-grained phase vocabulary (41 values across ~100 skills), and
    one banner line per value is not a dashboard. `hermes_role` is the coarse
    axis the product already documents in `docs/ROLES.md`, so it is what the
    directories mirror.

    The ULW engines are the one carve-out: they span six catalog categories and
    five roles, but a user reaching for them is reaching for the ULW engine
    family by name. Grouping them under `ultrawork` is what makes the banner
    able to say so. Membership reuses `ULW_ENGINE_SKILL_NAMES`, the same list
    that owns the `ulw-` label prefix, so a skill cannot be a ULW engine in one
